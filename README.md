## 🚀 About Me

I’m a Data Scientist, Geospatial Data Analyst (GIS), and Cartographer with a strong interest in transforming complex spatial and non-spatial datasets into actionable insights.
Currently completing my Master’s in Intelligent Systems and Multimedia, I specialize in Python-based data analysis, machine learning, and geospatial technologies. I’m actively seeking opportunities to apply my expertise to real-world challenges—particularly in projects at the intersection of AI, data visualization, and spatial intelligence.
